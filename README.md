# Loadablecomponents
a project to demo loadablecomponent pattern

- The LoadableComponent is a base class that aims to make writing PageObjects less painful. 
- It does this by providing a standard way of ensuring that pages are 
   loaded and providing hooks to make debugging the failure of a page to load easier. 
- You can use it to help reduce the amount of boilerplate code in your tests, which in turn make maintaining your tests less tiresome.
- LoadableComponent is another way to approach PageObjects. 
- LoadableComponent is a base class that all of the pages need to extend.
- The base class has the following methods on the interface:
    `get()
    isLoaded()
    load()`
- Instead of the usual public class PageObject, we change it:
    public class PageObject extends LoadableComponent<PageObject>
    Extending an abstract class is a contract to implement the methods in the parent class "load() and isLoaded()". 
    The load method will be designed to load the page; and the isLoaded() method should enable the validation if the page has been loaded correctly.â€ƒ


There is currently an implementation in Java that ships as part of Selenium 2, but the approach used is simple enough to be implemented in any language.

##Page locators if identified using the can be verified in the browser console

 ``$$("div#content > .heading")``
 2. xpath
