# Loadablecomponents
a project to demo loadablecomponent pattern

- The LoadableComponent is a base class that aims to make writing PageObjects less painful. 
- It does this by providing a standard way of ensuring that pages are loaded and providing hooks to make debugging the failure of a page to load easier. 
- You can use it to help reduce the amount of boilerplate code in your tests, which in turn make maintaining your tests less tiresome.

There is currently an implementation in Java that ships as part of Selenium 2, but the approach used is simple enough to be implemented in any language.
